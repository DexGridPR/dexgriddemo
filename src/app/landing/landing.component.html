        We see electric cooperatives, microgrids and other forms of distributed 
        energy resources (DERs) as living and growing organisms. To thrive, it 
        needs to be matched with a decentralized operating system. 

      </p>
      
      <p>
        As the system operator, the brain, DexGrid is the virtual utility that 
        promotes and facilitates their organic growth. 
        We are the virtual utility for distributed energy.

        We concentrate our effort in the Caribbean, starting with our home, 
        Puerto Rico.

                      can select preferred terms and payment plans to save on 
                      their power bill. Energy producers now have the opportunity to gain even 
                      more exposure to their neighbors.</p>
